//I know I didn't do this totally correctly. I know this would really need HTML and CSS as well. But I just tried to code what would be the JS code portion, which is probably still not correct.

var welcome = ('Welcome to the password validator tool')
var enter = ('Please enter a valid password')
console.log(welcome);
console.log(enter);

let password = ()
if (password.length >= 10){
    console.log('Password Successful')
}
else {
    console.log('Password Invalid')
}
