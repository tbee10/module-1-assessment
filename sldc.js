// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Maintain
// Planning
// Testing & Integration

1. Planning
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Implementation
5. Testing & Integreation
6. Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysis = "This is the second step, in which you will decide the business rules you need to follow and establish what the data models will look like"
const design = "This is the third step, in which you design the software "
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which you will code the software"
const testing = "This is the fifth step, where you will test and integrate the software"
const maintain = "This is the final step. After testing and implementation you will establsih maintenance, support and installation of the software"
